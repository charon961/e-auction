# e-auction
e-auction platform Project on client /admin role 

Idea: project has a login signup interface for user/client with proper validation check after registeration the data is stored in  table in mysql database in a table named users for the login page we search and match users credentials with the ones stored in database , once everything is checked on login our main page open where there are 10 character hardcoded (delete feature is available with admin) we can bid a value only if the price entered is greater than the current value which can be checked (we have to referesh the page to see the current status)

admin side we have features to delete a character using ids ,delete a client using id also to update a price of character using id.
